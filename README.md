# LogsSentinel — AI Agents in Production (SecOps)

I share practical guardrails for deploying AI agents in real environments.

## What you’ll find here

* **Agent guardrails**: least privilege, approvals, audit logs, safe defaults
* **Operational security checklists**: verification loops, evals, CI gates
* **Production mindset**: observability, rollback playbooks, incident readiness

## Quick start (recommended controls)

1. Scope tool access (least privilege, resource-level)
2. Human-in-the-loop confirmations for destructive actions
3. Tamper-evident audit trails + retention
4. Independent evaluation (tests/evals) before “action”
5. Rollback paths documented

## Notes

* No sensitive customer data, no PHI, no internal identifiers.
* Content is educational and focused on secure operations.
