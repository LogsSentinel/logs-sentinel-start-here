# LogsSentinel — AI Agents in Production (SecOps)

Practical guardrails for deploying **AI agents in real production environments** (for builders, SecOps, and SREs).

## What you’ll find here

* **Agent guardrails**: least privilege, approvals, audit logs, safe defaults
* **Operational security checklists**: verification loops, evals, CI gates
* **Production mindset**: observability, rollback playbooks, incident readiness

## Quick start: minimum controls for “agents that act”

1. **Scope tool access** (least privilege, resource-level)
2. **Human-in-the-loop approvals** for destructive actions
3. **Tamper-evident audit trails** + retention
4. **Independent verification** (tests/evals) before execution
5. **Rollback playbooks** documented (reversible changes)

## Notes

* No sensitive customer data, no PHI, no internal identifiers.
* Educational content focused on secure operations.
